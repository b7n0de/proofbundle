# Decisions of the pre-push gate

The gate in `hooks/proofbundle_gate.py` runs before every Bash call and before an MCP tool that opens a
pull request, a merge request or a release, pushes files, writes a file or merges a pull request. Where
the design was open, it takes the smallest variant that fails closed. Each decision below names that
choice and the options the owner can pick instead. The owner decided D2, D8, D13, D14, D16 and D17 on
2026-09-29; the rest is open until the owner decides.

## The declaration

A repository declares its evidence in `.proofbundle/evidence.json`:

```json
{
  "schema": "proofbundle-plugin/evidence/v0.2",
  "evidence": [
    {"kind": "bundle", "path": ".proofbundle/build.bundle.json", "policy": ".proofbundle/policy.json",
     "subject": {"algorithm": "proofbundle-tree-sha256/v1", "digest": "<64 lowercase hex>"}},
    {"kind": "decision", "path": ".proofbundle/release.decision.json", "public_key": "<issuer Ed25519 key, base64>",
     "subject": {"algorithm": "proofbundle-tree-sha256/v1", "digest": "<64 lowercase hex>"}}
  ]
}
```

- `kind` is `bundle` or `decision`. An `outcome` item is refused: an outcome receipt has no field that
  can carry a tree subject.
- `path` and `policy` are normalised paths under `.proofbundle/`, the folder the tree digest leaves out
  (D2). Evidence anywhere else would be part of the tree it names.
- A `decision` item names the issuer key it must verify under in `public_key`.
- A `bundle` item names a trust policy in `policy`, and that policy must pin a signer (D7).
- Every item names its `subject`: the tree digest of the commit it speaks for (D2).
- Any other key, a repeated key, another schema, more than 32 items, or a file above its size limit
  makes the declaration malformed.

## D1. Where the evidence is declared

Chosen: `.proofbundle/evidence.json` in the repository itself.

Options:
- A. In the repository (chosen).
- B. A path the user sets per installation, through the plugin's user configuration.
- C. Outside the repository, in a policy the owner signs, so a contributor cannot weaken it by editing
  the repository.

## D2. What "evidence for the current head" means

Chosen (owner, 2026-09-29): B. The declaration, every evidence file and every policy are read from the
commit at HEAD with `git cat-file`, never from the working tree, and each item is bound to the tree of
that commit.

- The subject is `proofbundle-tree-sha256/v1`: sha256 over the line `proofbundle-tree-sha256/v1`
  followed, for every file of the commit's tree sorted by the path's bytes, by
  `<mode> <sha256 of the file's bytes> <path>` and a NUL byte.
- The covered set is every file of HEAD except the top-level `.proofbundle/` folder, where the
  declaration and the evidence live. A folder of that name deeper in the tree is covered.
- The digest is computed from the commit alone, offline, and deterministically: modes come from git
  (100644, 100755, 120000) and bytes from the committed blobs, so checkout settings play no part. A tree
  with a submodule has no digest, and the gate says so.
- It is not the git tree id, which is SHA-1 and git's own object format. The README prints a recipe that
  computes the digest with git and coreutils, and `hooks/proofbundle_gate.py tree-digest` prints it.
- An item without a subject, or with a subject other than the digest of HEAD, is denied.
- After the evidence verifies, the gate reads the subject the signed part names, from the same
  committed bytes: a bundle's whole payload is `{"subject": {"algorithm": …, "digest": …}}`
  (`tree-digest --statement` prints it), and a decision receipt names it as an `inputSnapshot` entry
  with `uri` `urn:proofbundle-plugin:subject:proofbundle-tree-sha256/v1` and the digest under
  `digest.sha256`. Evidence whose signed part names another digest or none is denied.

What a pass then proves: the declared signer signed a statement that names the tree digest of the commit
at HEAD. It does not prove that any recorded value is true, and it says nothing about commits before
HEAD in the pushed range (D3).

Options:
- A. Bytes at HEAD, no subject binding.
- B. Each item names a subject digest equal to a digest of the pushed tree (chosen).
- C. Verify at every commit in the pushed range, not only at HEAD.

## D3. Which head

Chosen: HEAD of the repository the call acts on. That repository is the hook's working directory,
changed by a literal `cd <dir>`, `pushd <dir>` or `git -C <dir>` in the same command. A directory the
gate cannot resolve literally (a variable, `popd`, `--git-dir`, `--work-tree`) is NOT MEASURED. The
refspec is not read: `git push origin other-branch` is judged by the evidence at HEAD.

Options:
- A. HEAD only (chosen).
- B. Resolve each pushed refspec and verify at each pushed commit.
- C. Treat a push whose refspec is not the current branch as NOT MEASURED.

## D4. What a pass does

Chosen: no permission decision. The gate reports what it verified to the user and to the model, and
the host's normal permission flow decides whether the call runs. The gate never answers `allow`.

Options:
- A. No decision on a pass (chosen).
- B. `allow` on a pass, which skips the permission prompt for the call.

## D5. Nothing declared

Chosen: NOT MEASURED and `ask`. This covers:
- no declaration at HEAD, or a declaration only in the working tree;
- an empty evidence list;
- a directory outside a git work tree;
- a repository without a commit;
- a directory the gate cannot resolve.

The reason starts with `NOT MEASURED:` and says that nothing was verified. In a non-interactive run
(`claude -p`) an `ask` is a refusal.

Options:
- A. `ask` (chosen, as the task sets).
- B. `deny`, so a repository without a declaration cannot push through the plugin at all.

## D6. Failure is a deny

Chosen: `deny` for each of these:
- a malformed declaration;
- a declared file or policy missing at HEAD;
- a verification that does not exit 0;
- a verifier that cannot start;
- a gate that runs out of time;
- unreadable hook input;
- any error inside the gate.

Options:
- A. `deny` (chosen).
- B. `ask` for the cases where nothing was verified (the verifier did not start, time ran out), and
  `deny` only for failed or missing evidence.

## D7. Trust anchors

Chosen:
- A `decision` item must carry `public_key`.
- A `bundle` item must name a policy with a non-empty `allowed_issuers` and
  `signature.require_expected_signer: true`.
- The rest of the policy is judged by the verifier.

The pin is required because a bundle carries its own public key. Without a pinned signer, a bundle
signed by anyone would pass.

Options:
- A. Pin required (chosen).
- B. Accept a bundle policy without a pinned signer.
- C. Accept a bundle without any policy.

## D8. Which calls are gated

Chosen (owner, 2026-09-29): B, and the three GitHub MCP tools that write without opening a pull
request, `push_files`, `create_or_update_file` and `merge_pull_request`, gated as well.
- Bash calls: `git push` (and `git-push`), `gh pr create` or `gh pr new`, `gh release create` or
  `gh release new`, found:
  - anywhere in the Bash command, after `&&`, `;`, `|` and newlines;
  - behind environment assignments, `sudo`, `command` or `env`;
  - inside `$( )` and backticks;
  - inside any quoted argument, as in `bash -c "git push"`.
  Over-matching is accepted: `echo "git push"` is gated too. A command that cannot be tokenised is gated
  when a text search finds a gated call, with the directory NOT MEASURED.
- MCP tools, through a second `PreToolUse` matcher,
  `^mcp__.+__(create_pull_request|create_merge_request|create_release|push_files|create_or_update_file|merge_pull_request)$`,
  on any server. Both hosts name an MCP tool `mcp__<server>__<tool>` in the hook event, and both read a
  matcher like this one as a regular expression (Codex at c248f6d4: `hooks/src/events/common.rs`,
  `matches_matcher`). The repository is the hook's working directory; the tool's own arguments (owner,
  repository, branch) are not read.
  - Gated tool names: `create_pull_request` (the GitHub MCP server, as `mcp__github__create_pull_request`),
    `create_merge_request` and `create_release` (names other servers use; which servers, not measured),
    and the GitHub MCP server's `push_files`, `create_or_update_file` and `merge_pull_request`.
  - What the gate cannot see, and says in every answer to an MCP tool: it judges the local repository at
    HEAD, not the remote. It cannot see the branch a tool publishes or the pull request `merge_pull_request`
    merges. The bytes `push_files` and `create_or_update_file` write come from the tool's own arguments,
    and the gate does not compare them with the tree it judged, so a pass says the local evidence holds,
    not that the pushed bytes are the ones it covers.
  - Ungated, and listed as such: every other name. Open, the owner kept them out of the gate on
    2026-09-29: `delete_file`, `create_branch`, `update_pull_request`, `update_pull_request_branch` and
    `enable_pr_auto_merge`, which write to a remote without opening a pull request. Also ungated:
    `fork_repository` and `create_repository`. A tool of another server with a different name for the
    same act is not gated either.

Not seen:
- git aliases;
- scripts and make targets that push;
- `gh api`;
- other command-line tools such as `glab`.

Options:
- A. Bash calls only.
- B. Also gate MCP tools whose names create pull requests or releases, with a second matcher (chosen),
  plus `push_files`, `create_or_update_file` and `merge_pull_request` (chosen).
- C. B plus the five open tools above.

## D9. The hook runs on every Bash call

Chosen: the hook has no `if` filter. A filter such as `Bash(git push*)` would miss compound and nested
forms. The cost is one Python start per Bash call: median 42 ms, maximum 53 ms over 20 calls on the
build machine, for a call the gate does not gate.

Options:
- A. Every Bash call (chosen).
- B. An `if` filter, faster but blind to compound forms.

## D10. When the gate itself cannot run

Chosen:
- If `python3` is missing or the gate crashes, the hook command exits 2, which blocks the call. This
  blocks every Bash call until the plugin or the interpreter is fixed.
- The hook timeout is 120 s. The gate denies at its own 90 s deadline, because Claude Code lets a call
  run when a PreToolUse command hook times out.

Options:
- A. Block (chosen).
- B. Let the call run when the gate cannot start, and report it.

## D11. The verifier

Chosen: the gate verifies through the plugin's own MCP server, `server/proofbundle_mcp.py`, started
with `uv run --script`. Its `verify_receipt` tool is the one the skills use, and its pin
(`proofbundle==6.1.0`) is the only pin. Without `uv`, or without a cached or reachable PyPI, the
verifier does not start and the gate denies (D6).

Options:
- A. The plugin's MCP server (chosen).
- B. A `proofbundle` command on `PATH`, which would verify with whatever version is installed.

## D12. Codex has no ask

Chosen: under Codex, the gate runs with `--host codex` and answers every NOT MEASURED case with deny.
The reason still starts with `NOT MEASURED:`.

Measured in the Codex source (openai/codex at c248f6d4):
- `codex-rs/hooks/src/engine/output_parser.rs` rejects `permissionDecision: "ask"` as unsupported;
- `codex-rs/hooks/src/events/pre_tool_use.rs` then marks the hook as failed without blocking;
- an ask would therefore let the call run.

Options:
- A. Deny under Codex (chosen).
- B. Let the call run under Codex when nothing is declared, and report NOT MEASURED in a message.

## D13. Codex runs plugin hooks only after the user trusts them

Codex keeps a plugin's hooks inactive until the user reviews and trusts them: at the start-up review,
in `/hooks`, or with `--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust`. Until then the gate does not run under Codex,
and a push is not gated. The plugin cannot change this.

Chosen (owner, 2026-09-29): A, plus a note. The README says it, and under Codex every result of
`verify_receipt` carries a `gate_note` saying that the gate runs only if the hooks are trusted and that
the server cannot see whether they are or whether the gate ran. The verify skill passes the note on and
never states that the gate ran. Nothing the MCP server can read tells whether the hooks are trusted, so
the note is a stated limit, not a detection. The server learns that it runs under Codex from
`PROOFBUNDLE_PLUGIN_HOST=codex` in the Codex manifest's server entry.

Options:
- A. Document it (chosen, with the note).
- B. Detect in the verify skill whether the gate ran in the session. Not possible from the server.

## D14. One folder, two manifests

Chosen (owner, 2026-09-29): A, in `plugins/proofbundle`.
- `plugins/proofbundle` carries `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` for Claude Code and
  `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` for Codex.
- Both manifests use the same `skills/`, `server/proofbundle_mcp.py` and
  `hooks/proofbundle_gate.py`. No file is copied.
- Codex reads `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` before `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. Its manifest declares
  its MCP server and its hook inline, so Codex never reads `.mcp.json` or `hooks/hooks.json`. Codex does
  not expand `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` in an MCP entry.
- Symlinks were ruled out:
  - Codex drops a symlink when it copies a plugin into its cache (openai/codex
    `core-plugins/src/store.rs`).
  - Claude Code 2.1.284, measured on install, keeps a link that stays inside the plugin, and replaces
    a link pointing outside with a copy of its target.
  - A shared folder reached by symlinks would therefore work under Claude Code and vanish under Codex.
- The emit skill's rule "only when the user invokes it" is written twice, once per host:
  `disable-model-invocation` in SKILL.md for Claude Code, and `agents/openai.yaml` for Codex. It is the
  same rule in each host's own format, not a copy of one file.

Options:
- A. One folder (chosen).
- B. Two folders with byte-identical copies, held equal by a test.

## D15. One marketplace file

Chosen: no `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`. Codex 0.159.0 reads `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
when no `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` exists. Measured: `codex plugin marketplace add` on the
repository, then `codex plugin add proofbundle@proofbundle`, installed version 0.3.0 from
`.codex-plugin/plugin.json`.

Options:
- A. One file for both hosts (chosen).
- B. A separate `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`, for Codex-only fields such as `policy.installation`
  or `category`.

## D16. Whether the gate runs inside a Codex turn

Chosen (owner, 2026-09-29): C. Measured after the tag v6.2.0, at the owner's machine with the owner's
account, never in the cloud. Until then the README marks it NOT MEASURED. RUNBOOK_CODEX.md holds the
exact commands, the expected answer for each case and the pass criteria.

What is measured without a Codex turn: the gate's answers under `--host codex` against Codex's hook
output schema (tests/test_codex_plugin.py), and the manifest, server and skills Codex reads from this
folder.

Options:
- A. Measure in a cloud session with a mock model.
- B. Leave it unmeasured.
- C. Measure at the owner's machine after the tag (chosen).

## D17. The declaration format changed inside the unreleased 0.3.0

Chosen (owner, 2026-09-29): A.
- Version 0.2.0 reads `proofbundle-plugin/evidence/v0.1`. Version 0.3.0 reads only
  `proofbundle-plugin/evidence/v0.2`, whose items name a tree subject (D2), and refuses a v0.1 declaration
  with "schema must be 'proofbundle-plugin/evidence/v0.2'". There is no migration.
- Both versions go to the repository after the tag v6.2.0, as planned.
- The first marketplace entry comes only with 0.3.0. Adding it is the owner's act and part of no change
  here.

Options:
- A. Both versions to the repository after the tag, the first marketplace entry with 0.3.0 (chosen).
- B. Only 0.3.0.
- C. A reader for v0.1 in 0.3.0.
