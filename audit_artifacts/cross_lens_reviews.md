# Cross-lens review — WP-B1: `merkle.hash_alg` REQUIRED + SPEC_REVISION + extended `--version`

Closes #28. Four-iteration review performed before commit, per the work-package instructions.

## A — Evidence (what proves conformance)

- `SPEC.md` §5: `hash_alg` row changed `required: no` → `yes`, MUST wording added, explicit
  anti-algorithm-confusion sentence ("a verifier MUST NOT silently default a missing value ...
  exactly where an algorithm-confusion attack would hide"). Header gains `Revision: 2026-07-09`.
- `schemas/proofbundle_v0_1.schema.json`: `hash_alg` added to `merkle.required`.
- `src/proofbundle/bundle.py`: new shared helper `_require_hash_alg(mk)` used by BOTH
  `verify_bundle` and `recompute_merkle_root_b64` (previously two independent `_require(...)`
  call sites with identical logic but no shared message) — raises `BundleFormatError` naming the
  field, the SPEC.md pointer, and the exact JSON fix.
- `src/proofbundle/__init__.py`: `SPEC_REVISION = "2026-07-09"` next to `__version__`, exported
  in `__all__`.
- `src/proofbundle/cli.py`: `--version` now emits a 4-line block (version / spec-revision /
  schema / features) via a custom `_VersionAction` (the built-in `action="version"` runs the
  string through `HelpFormatter`, which collapses embedded newlines — verified this is real by
  reading `argparse.HelpFormatter._fill_text`, which regex-collapses all whitespace including
  `\n` before wrapping); `_detect_features()` is a fail-safe, try/except-per-capability probe of
  `eval` / `sdjwt` / `anchors[beta]` / `pq` / `inspect` / `experimental`.
- Tests added (7): `tests/test_bundle_robustness.py` (missing hash_alg → error w/ migration hint,
  same in `recompute_merkle_root_b64`, wrong value → `UnsupportedError`), `tests/test_cli.py`
  (direct `main(["--version"])` content check, no-subcommand short-circuit contract preserved,
  end-to-end subprocess through the real `python -m proofbundle.cli` process boundary),
  `tests/test_docs_truth.py` (`SPEC_REVISION` == SPEC.md's own `Revision:` line, in the style of
  the existing CITATION.cff↔pyproject sync test).
- Full suite: 487/487 passed (`python -m unittest discover -s tests`, was run both before and
  after every substantive edit in this WP). `ruff check .` clean. `python -m mypy src` clean.
  Manual smoke: `proofbundle --version` (installed console script), `python -m proofbundle.cli
  --version`, `--help`, and a bare `proofbundle` (no subcommand) all behave as expected, stderr
  empty on `--version` (no stray `ExperimentalWarning`).

## B — Break (adversarial)

1. **Real bug found and fixed**: the `pq` feature probe in `_detect_features()` initially caught
   only `ImportError`. The exact pattern it mirrors, `checkpoint.py::_mldsa_module()`, catches
   `(ImportError, AttributeError)` — its own docstring documents why: a `cryptography>=48` build
   *without* an OpenSSL 3.5+ PQ backend has the `mldsa` module but not the `MLDSA44PublicKey`
   class, which is an `AttributeError`, not an `ImportError`. Left as `except ImportError`, this
   probe would have raised uncaught out of `_detect_features()` on exactly that class of install —
   crashing `--version` itself, the opposite of "fail-safe, never a traceback" the work package
   asked for. Fixed to `except (ImportError, AttributeError)`.
2. Checked whether a bundle without `hash_alg` can still reach a PASS through any emit path:
   `emit.py` always writes `"hash_alg": "sha256-rfc6962"` unconditionally (grepped, confirmed) —
   no emitter code path can produce a bundle missing it. Only a hand-authored/pre-v1.6 archived
   bundle can hit the new-required error, matching the CHANGELOG's "who this breaks" claim.
3. Checked whether the schema's `default` annotation on `hash_alg` was now misleading given the
   field is `required` and the SPEC text says a verifier MUST NOT silently default it: it was
   (`"default": "sha256-rfc6962"` sitting on a required field invites a schema-driven code
   generator or defaulting library to treat absence as safe) — removed, replaced with a
   description note pointing at the MUST-not-default rule.
4. Checked the `--help` / usage line still renders `[--version]` correctly and the custom action's
   `help=` text appears in the options list (it does — verified by running `--help`).
5. Checked `--version` still short-circuits before argparse's `command required` check (the
   original behavior of `action="version"`, which this replaces) — verified: `proofbundle
   --version` with no subcommand exits 0 with the version block, unaffected by `required=True` on
   the subparsers group.
6. Checked no doc (`README.md`, `docs/*.md`) hardcodes the old single-line `--version` format —
   none found, so no additional doc drift from this change.

## C — Fix

Both findings from B were applied directly (not deferred): the `pq` probe's except clause and the
schema's stale `default`. Both are included in this commit set, not left as follow-ups.

## D — Cross-review (2 lenses)

### Lens: Trust-UX
- **Concern**: does a user who hits the new-required error understand *why* and *how to fix it*
  without reading source?
- **Result**: the message states the missing field, cites SPEC.md §5, gives the literal JSON
  fragment to add (`"hash_alg": "sha256-rfc6962"`), and reassures that current emitters are
  unaffected — actionable without a source read.
- **Changes**: none additional; assessed sufficient as written.
- **Residual risk**: the message does not suggest *checking what produced the bundle* if the user
  didn't hand-author it (e.g. "if this wasn't hand-written, the tool that made it predates v1.6").
  Minor — left as-is; the fix instruction is already correct and self-contained.

### Lens: Governance (doc/schema/code single-source-of-truth)
- **Concern**: SPEC.md itself says "where the two disagree, this document is normative and the
  schema is a bug" — did this WP eliminate the disagreement everywhere, not just patch the
  symptom the issue named?
- **Result**: SPEC.md, the JSON Schema, and both code call sites (`verify_bundle`,
  `recompute_merkle_root_b64`) are now aligned on `hash_alg` being required. `SPEC_REVISION` is
  pinned to SPEC.md's own header by an executable test (`test_spec_revision_matches_spec_md`), so
  a future SPEC.md edit that bumps the revision without touching the constant (or vice versa) goes
  red instead of silently drifting the way the `required: no` row had for at least since v1.6.
  This lens is *what caught* finding B.3 (the stale schema `default`).
- **Changes**: schema `default` removal (already applied under C).
- **Residual risk, stated honestly**:
  - `docs/archive/REVIEW_v1.6.md` still shows `⬜ test_merkle_missing_hash_alg_rejected` as an open
    checklist item from that historical review. Deliberately **not** edited here — it is an
    archived historical snapshot of what was known/done *at that review's time*, and retroactively
    checking it off would misrepresent history. The test now exists
    (`test_missing_hash_alg_rejected_with_migration_hint`); the archive doc is simply stale by
    design of being an archive. Flagged, not fixed.
  - Issue #28 is currently assigned to an external contributor (`onxxdatas` / Abdulaziz) on
    GitHub. This WP closes it from the owner's side; the maintainer should acknowledge/re-triage
    the assignment when merging (attribution courtesy), which is outside what a branch commit can
    do. Flagged, not something this change can resolve.

# Cross-lens review — WP-B2: CRYPTO/POLICY/ASSURANCE separation + exit-code 3 + stable JSON fields

Six-lens adversarial pre-land review (Claude sonnet subagents), per the WP-B2 matrix row (patch
cross-checked by the Crypto + Ecosystem lenses; typical conflict: "label suggests more than crypto
proves; JSON contract unstable"). Build commit `d602802`, fixes commit `3d299f5`.

## A — Evidence (what proves conformance)
- `verify` human output relabelled `CRYPTO:` / `POLICY:` / `ASSURANCE:` / `LIMITATIONS:`; the bare
  `=> OK` marker removed for `verify` (test asserts `assertNotIn("=> OK")`).
- `verify --json` stable single-field contract (`schema_ok … crypto_ok policy_ok assurance
  sd_jwt_issuer_verified warnings[] limitations[]`); a check that did not run in the offline core
  path is `null`, never silently `true`; existing keys (`ok`/`checks`/`matrix`/`meaning`) untouched.
- Exit-code contract 0/1/2/3 via pure `_verify_exit_code`; documented in `verify --help` + README.
- `THREAT_MODEL.md` "Misuse: reading OK as truth" (three operator-error examples).

## B — Break (the ten findings the lenses surfaced)
- **[HIGH] sd_jwt_ok silently true without an issuer key** (L1+L2, convergent): `sd_jwt_vc` is
  outside `payload_b64` (Ed25519 does not cover it); with no `issuer_public_key_b64` the issuer
  signature is never checked, yet the `else True` ternary read the missing check as a pass — a
  self-consistent unsigned SD-JWT reported `sd_jwt_ok: true`.
- **[HIGH] ASSURANCE-line injection** (L3): `decode_eval_claim` did not enum-validate
  `assurance_level` (the emit path does), so a hand-signed claim could embed newlines to print
  forged `CRYPTO:`/`POLICY:` lines in the human output.
- **[MED] Exit-2 error JSON carried no contract fields** (L2) → integrator KeyError on `crypto_ok`.
- **[MED] "not an eval receipt" false when a real receipt's crypto fails** (L3+L4).
- **[MED] Deeply-nested JSON → raw RecursionError + exit 1** instead of malformed exit 2 (L3).
- **[MED] `--policy`/exit-3 documented as if already working** in epilog + README (L6).
- **[MED] CHANGELOG missing a WP-B2 BREAKING entry** for the `=> OK` removal + new exit 3 (L6).
- **[MED] True path of `sd_jwt_ok`/`key_binding_ok`/`audience_ok`/`nonce_ok` untested** — L5's
  mutation (force them to null) stayed green.
- **[LOW] "§1.4" phantom citation** (from the prompt, no such published doc) in docstrings/tests (L6).
- **[LOW] Mermaid diagram still showed `=> OK`** for the verify flow (L6).

## C — Fix (all ten, commit `3d299f5`)
- `sd_jwt_ok` fail-closed: `null` when structure ok but issuer sig unchecked, `False` when structure
  broken, `True` only when structure + issuer sig both pass; new granular `sd_jwt_issuer_verified`
  field + a warning.
- `decode_eval_claim` rejects out-of-enum `assurance_level` (closes the emit-vs-verify asymmetry);
  `_safe_line` neutralises control chars as defense-in-depth (also for WP-B3's `_policy_line`).
- Error-path JSON emits the full field contract (`crypto_ok=false`, checks `null`).
- ASSURANCE `n/a` distinguishes "crypto verification failed" vs "not an eval receipt".
- `load_bundle` maps `RecursionError` → `BundleFormatError` (exit 2) for all consumers.
- Epilog + README mark `--policy`/exit-3 as "lands with WP-B3"; CHANGELOG WP-B2 BREAKING entry added.
- New tests exercise the real key-bound SD-JWT presentation (green + red counter-tests); "§1.4" →
  `verify --help`; Mermaid `=> OK` → `CRYPTO: OK / FAILED`.

## D — Cross-review (Crypto + Ecosystem lenses)
- **Crypto (L1)**: confirmed `verify_bundle`/crypto core UNTOUCHED; the change is presentation-only.
  `crypto_ok == result.ok`; 0-check bypass unreachable (ed25519 + merkle always added). After the
  fix, `sd_jwt_ok` no longer overclaims an unsigned SD-JWT.
- **Ecosystem (L2/L6)**: JSON contract additive — no key collision (23 keys with `--verbose`),
  error path now field-complete; `--policy`/exit-3 honestly WP-B3-pending; CHANGELOG BREAKING entry
  covers the `=> OK` grep break.
- **No-fake (L4)**: zero overclaims; ASSURANCE confirmed verbatim; commit numbers (511 tests, ruff,
  mypy) independently re-verified.

## Residual risk (honest)
- Other verify subcommands (`verify-proof`/`show-eval`/`verify-enclave`/…) keep their bare `=> OK`.
  They carry per-check `[PASS]` context lines (not "context-free"), but are not yet under the
  CRYPTO/POLICY split. Deferred — WP-B2 scope is the core `verify` + meaning-block path. Documented.
- `audience_ok`/`nonce_ok` mirror `key_binding_ok` when requested (the aud/nonce equality IS inside
  that check); a nonce-only mismatch shows both False (conservative/fail-closed, not a security gap).
- The exit-3 CLI trigger (`--policy`) lands with WP-B3; here it is unit-tested as a pure function.

# Cross-lens review — WP-B3: trust policy v0.1 + `verify --policy`

Six-lens adversarial pre-land review (Claude sonnet subagents) per the WP-B3 matrix row (cross-checked
by the SD-JWT + Governance lenses; typical conflict: "policy demands fields a profile can't supply;
fail-open on partial config"). Build commit `e93620c`, fixes commit follows.

## A — Evidence
- `schemas/trust_policy_v0_1.schema.json`, `src/proofbundle/policy.py` (`load_policy` fail-closed
  parse + `evaluate_policy` over the crypto result), `verify --policy` (crypto-first), example + docs.

## B — Break (findings; the SD-JWT section carried the two most serious)
- **[HIGH] `require_nonce` fail-OPEN** (L1 F1 + L2 F1, convergent): `evaluate_policy` re-derived the
  nonce from a standalone `verify_key_binding()` and checked only presence, never the crypto verdict —
  an unsigned/unauthenticated KB-JWT with an attacker-picked nonce gave `POLICY: OK`, exit 0. The
  sibling `expected_aud` is safe because it routes through `verify_bundle`.
- **[MED] `require_key_binding_when_cnf_present` missing `else`** (L1 F2): an attached-but-unverified
  KB segment fell through both branches → the declared requirement produced zero audit entries.
- **[MED] `evaluate_policy` did not enforce `result.ok` itself** (L2 F2): a public-API consumer that
  didn't replicate the CLI's `crypto_ok` gate could get `policy_ok=True` on tampered bytes.
- **[MED] type-confusion — `signature.allowed_algs` as a string** (L1 F3 + L3 F1 + L4 F1, convergent):
  no list-check → Python `in` degraded to substring match (`"ed25519" in "xed25519y"`). All other
  declared field types were unchecked too (L4 F2).
- **[MED] the JSON Schema was never applied/tested** (L4 F3): pure documentation, drift-prone.
- **[MED] `load_policy` not fail-closed on `RecursionError`** (L3 F2): deep JSON escaped as a raw
  traceback, against the module's own contract.
- **[MED] freshness only stale-tested; `all()`→`any()` and schema/alg checks untested; policy-only
  `expected_aud` fallback untested** (L5 F1–F4): mutations stayed green.
- **[LOW] no defensive copy on dict input** (L4 F4); **[LOW] no TUF-like key rotation, undocumented in
  the new policy chapter** (L6).
- L3 confirmed injection is already hardened (`_safe_line` + `repr`); L6 found the artifacts otherwise
  fully consistent + live-verified.

## C — Fix (all fixed)
- `require_nonce` now gates on the authoritative `sd-jwt-key-binding` check's `.ok` — no verified KB →
  fail closed (an unauthenticated nonce provides no replay protection). `require_key_binding` gains the
  else-branch (unverified attached KB → fail closed). `evaluate_policy` returns `policy_ok=None` on
  `not result.ok` itself. `load_policy` type-checks every declared field (list-of-str / bool / str),
  catches `RecursionError`→`PolicyError`, and deep-copies a dict input. `TestSchemaConsistency` +
  `TestVerifyLensFixes` (schema↔example↔parser, the substring red-test, all-vs-any, freshness-fresh,
  require_nonce fail-closed + real-True path, policy-only aud). TRUST_ANCHORS.md documents the
  require_nonce value-binding boundary + the no-key-rotation limit.

## D — Cross-review (SD-JWT + Governance lenses)
- **SD-JWT (L2)**: after the fix, the nonce/key-binding checks route through the crypto layer's
  authoritative verdict, matching `expected_aud`; assurance ordering + freshness confirmed correct.
- **Governance (L6)**: v0.1 policy = static pinned-key authority (like a sigstore
  `ClusterImagePolicy.authorities[].key` or an in-toto functionary pin); no signature threshold (a
  bundle carries one signer) and no key rotation — now stated in TRUST_ANCHORS.md, no hidden overclaim.

## Residual risk (honest)
- `require_nonce` binds nonce PRESENCE in a verified KB; binding the nonce VALUE still needs `--nonce`
  (documented), and a policy-only `expected_nonce` field (symmetric to `expected_aud`) is a
  forward-compatible follow-up, not in v0.1.
- `status` remains fail-closed-when-enabled (no snapshot input in v0.1).
