"""Canonical Statement primitive — the one home for the universal content root (ADR 0002).

The *content root* of an in-toto Statement is ``SHA-256`` over the RFC-8785 (JCS) canonical bytes of the
**full** Statement (``_type``, ``subject``, ``predicateType``, ``predicate`` — never a predicate-only or
field-subset canonicalization) taken BEFORE signing. The signature bytes are NEVER part of the preimage, so
the root survives counter-signing, key rotation and multi-signature envelopes (proofbundle#7 consensus,
2026-07-10). ``contentRootAlg`` for this definition is ``jcs-sha256-v1`` (see ``CONTENT_ROOT_ALG``).

Two-part rule (ADR 0002):

* a PRODUCER emits its Statement canonically (``canonicalize_statement``) and signs exactly those bytes;
* a VERIFIER hashes the EXACT transmitted payload bytes and NEVER re-canonicalizes — a payload that deviates
  from its own canonical form is a fail-closed error the caller must reject.

``statement_content_root`` serves both sides from one definition: given a JSON object it canonicalizes then
hashes (producer); given raw ``bytes`` it hashes exactly those bytes (verifier). Both yield the SAME 32-byte
root when the producer emitted canonically — which is the whole point of a content root: a verifier that
passes the exact signed payload bytes reproduces the producer's root without trusting a re-serialization.

The RFC-8785 canonicalizer ships in the ``[eval]`` extra (``rfc8785``); it is imported LAZILY so the base
install and the plain no-anchor verify path stay dependency-free. A missing extra is a clear fail-closed
``CanonicalizerUnavailable``, never a raw ``ImportError``.

This module is intentionally tiny and dependency-light: it is the shared primitive that the decision-receipt
predicate (``decision.py``) and, across the 2.1.0 migration (ADR 0002), the eval-result / svr in-toto export
paths converge on. Providing it here does NOT change any released wire format — the migration of the released
``intoto`` export paths off ``json.dumps(sort_keys=True)`` is a separate T3 / SemVer owner-gated step.
