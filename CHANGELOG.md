# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project adheres
to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added
- **Eval-receipt emitter** (`src/proofbundle/evalclaim.py`): turn a reproducible eval
  run into a signed, Merkle-anchored receipt that proves *suite S `comparator` threshold
  T, passed* while carrying only **salted commitments** to the model and dataset
  identifiers (never the weights, data, or plaintext names). Built on `emit_bundle`, so
  the existing `verify_bundle` verifies a receipt unchanged.
  - `build_eval_claim` computes `passed` itself; `emit_eval_receipt` binds the receipt to
    the signer (`issuer` field in the signed payload); `decode_eval_claim` verifies the
    bundle **and** the issuer binding.
  - RFC 8785 JCS canonicalization on the **emit path only** (UTF-16 key sort, NFC, duplicate-
    key + Python-float rejection, safe-int range); the verify path checks stored bytes, so the
    verifier stays dependency-free.
- File-based framework adapters (`proofbundle.adapters.from_lm_eval_results`,
  `from_inspect_ai_log`) that read exported result JSON without importing the framework.
- CLI: `proofbundle emit-eval` and `proofbundle show-eval`.
- `EVAL_CLAIM.md` (normative claim spec + data-minimization) and
  `schemas/eval_claim_v0_1.schema.json` with a validation test.
- Optional extras: `proofbundle[eval]` (RFC 8785 canonicalizer, emit side), `proofbundle[adapters]`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added
- **External RFC 6962 conformance**: verifies canonical inclusion vectors vendored
  from transparency-dev/merkle (tests/fixtures/rfc6962_vectors.json) — proven
  RFC-conformant, not merely self-consistent. Plus Hypothesis property tests
  (inclusion + consistency) for trees up to several hundred leaves.
- **Sigstore Rekor interop**: `examples/rekor_interop.py` verifies a real Sigstore
  Rekor inclusion proof (logIndex 25579, tree size 4.16M) fully offline, with a
  committed fixture and a field-mapping doc (Rekor bundle / C2SP checkpoint).
- SD-JWT is an optional extra: `pip install "proofbundle[sdjwt]"` (core stays
  cryptography-only).
- Normative format specification `SPEC.md` (fields, encodings, RFC 6962 hashing,
  verification order), consistent with the JSON Schema.
- `.github/dependabot.yml` (github-actions + pip).
- PyPI Trusted Publishing (OIDC) publish job in the release workflow.

### Changed
- All GitHub Actions pinned to full commit SHAs (post tj-actions incident).
- SD-JWT docstrings/README cite RFC 9901 (SD-JWT core, Dec 2025); clarify SD-JWT VC
  is still an IETF draft.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added
- Bundle emitter: `emit_bundle` signs a payload with Ed25519 and anchors it as
  the last leaf of an RFC 6962 Merkle tree, producing a bundle that
  `verify_bundle` accepts — the offline counterpart to the verifier.
- Signing-key helpers `generate_signer`, `save_signer`, `load_signer` (raw 32
  byte Ed25519 seeds).
- `proofbundle emit` command line interface (`--payload-file`, `--new-key` /
  `--key`, `--out`).
- Emit-then-verify round-trip tests, including prior-leaf anchoring, tamper
  detection and key save/load.

### Notes
- No new runtime dependency; the emitter reuses the existing Merkle logic and
  `cryptography`. The v0.3 eval-receipt emitter remains a roadmap stub.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added
- Offline evidence bundle verifier (`proofbundle/v0.1` schema).
- Published JSON Schema (`schemas/proofbundle_v0_1.schema.json`) with a
  validation test, `py.typed` marker and community files (Code of Conduct,
  issue and pull-request templates).
- RFC 6962 / RFC 9162 Merkle inclusion and consistency proof verification.
- Ed25519 signature verification via `cryptography`.
- Minimal SD-JWT selective-disclosure verification (EdDSA issuer signatures,
  disclosure-digest commitment check).
- `proofbundle verify` command line interface with human and JSON output.
- Example bundle generator (`examples/make_example.py`) and a real example bundle.
- Full unit test suite (Merkle round-trip across sizes, signature, bundle, CLI).
- Emitter roadmap stub for v0.2 (bundle emission) and v0.3 (eval receipts).
