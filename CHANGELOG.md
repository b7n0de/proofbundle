# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project adheres
to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added
- Bundle emitter: `emit_bundle` signs a payload with Ed25519 and anchors it as
  the last leaf of an RFC 6962 Merkle tree, producing a bundle that
  `verify_bundle` accepts — the offline counterpart to the verifier.
- Signing-key helpers `generate_signer`, `save_signer`, `load_signer` (raw 32
  byte Ed25519 seeds).
- `proofbundle emit` command line interface (`--payload-file`, `--new-key` /
  `--key`, `--out`).
- Emit-then-verify round-trip tests, including prior-leaf anchoring, tamper
  detection and key save/load.

### Notes
- No new runtime dependency; the emitter reuses the existing Merkle logic and
  `cryptography`. The v0.3 eval-receipt emitter remains a roadmap stub.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added
- Offline evidence bundle verifier (`proofbundle/v0.1` schema).
- Published JSON Schema (`schemas/proofbundle_v0_1.schema.json`) with a
  validation test, `py.typed` marker and community files (Code of Conduct,
  issue and pull-request templates).
- RFC 6962 / RFC 9162 Merkle inclusion and consistency proof verification.
- Ed25519 signature verification via `cryptography`.
- Minimal SD-JWT selective-disclosure verification (EdDSA issuer signatures,
  disclosure-digest commitment check).
- `proofbundle verify` command line interface with human and JSON output.
- Example bundle generator (`examples/make_example.py`) and a real example bundle.
- Full unit test suite (Merkle round-trip across sizes, signature, bundle, CLI).
- Emitter roadmap stub for v0.2 (bundle emission) and v0.3 (eval receipts).
